==BUILDING==

Provided is a simple makefile. To build the project, use the make command. You
can run it with make run 

==TODO==

-This raytracer was written for my graphics class at BYU (CS 455). A major
porition of this class, was focused on reimplementing a subset of OpenGL's
commands. I started this project by simply copying and pasting my
OpenGL-reimplemenation project so that I could reuse some of my existing code
(e.g. the classes I used for matrices, mathematical vectors, and a class for
managing the raster). I still need to remove this extra code from the
repository. The raytracer is not tightly coupled to this extra code, but it is
still going to take some time to disentangle.

-Simplify and improve the makefile. As of now, the dependencies for the targets
might not be entirely right.

-Add simple refraction.

-Add lens distortion.

-Upgrade to C++ and remove dependency on boost
